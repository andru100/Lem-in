# Lem-in
Solution to the Lem-in problem where you are given n amount of ants, rooms and connections between rooms/nodes in a txt file. The program uses Breadth First Search to locate all possible routes by shortest first. Then takes into account route length and assigns ants to ques for each route. So that they make it to the end node in shortest time possible with the least steps.
To see the solution type 'go run . ' and add your chosen example.txt eg 'go run . example01.txt'
